#  Former Employees

- Using SQLAlchemy, design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Dependencies and Setup

```bash
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from config import username, password
%matplotlib inline

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(f'postgresql://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/employees_db')
connection = engine.connect()
```


## Roadmap
- Inspect the CSV files sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables
